# initial_setup/starter_projects/ — Starter Flow Templates

## Purpose
Pre-built flow JSON files that are loaded into new Langflow installations as example/template projects.

## For LLM Coding Agents

- Each `.json` file is a complete flow definition.
- Add new starter projects by creating a new JSON file here.
- These are loaded by `initial_setup/setup.py` during first-run initialization.
