# legacy_custom/ — Legacy Custom Component Support

## Purpose
Backward compatibility support for the older custom component format. Maintained so existing flows with legacy custom components continue to work.

## Key Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `customs.py` | Legacy custom component loading and registration. |

## For LLM Coding Agents

- Do not add new code here. New custom component work should go in `custom/`.
- This exists solely for backward compatibility.
