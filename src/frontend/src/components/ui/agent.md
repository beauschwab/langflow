# components/ui/ — shadcn/ui Primitives

## Purpose
UI primitive components from shadcn/ui (built on Radix UI). These are the foundational building blocks for the Langflow UI — buttons, inputs, dialogs, dropdowns, tabs, sheets, popovers, etc.

## For LLM Coding Agents
- These components are auto-generated by `npx shadcn-ui add <component>`.
- Do not modify directly unless customizing behavior — re-running the generator overwrites changes.
- Use these as building blocks in higher-level components.
